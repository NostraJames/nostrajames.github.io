## The Story Behind Full Squish

When I first got into mountain biking, I knew almost nothing about bikesâ€”geometry, suspension, gearing, none of it. But honestly? I didn't think it mattered. I started riding right when Specialized teamed up with Fox to develop the autosag feature, and suddenly I didn't need to learn anything. The bike just worked.

After years of riding and pushing myself to get better, trying different bikes and diving into suspension design, I had a realization: **any bike can feel good if you dial in the suspension.** That's the biggest hurdle, I thinkâ€”not the bike you're on, but getting your suspension tuned right.

So I watched videos, read forums, and started tweaking. But keeping track of what worked (and what didn't) was a total chore. I'd think I'd remember my settings, or I'd scribble them down somewhere and inevitably forget. Then I'd make changes, lose track of what the original setup was, and end up starting from scratch.

And it wasn't just about one setup. I'd dial in my suspension for flow trailsâ€”something stiffer and responsive. But then I'd head somewhere with gnarly, technical descents and need to soften things up. Completely different tune. Easy to forget. Risking having to troubleshoot all over again.

**So I built Full Squish.** A simple tool to track your settings, add notes about how changes feel on specific trails, and easily switch between setups. If something doesn't work, you can just revert to your original settings. Simple.

My hope is that riders find it useful and share their ideas. I want this app to evolve into something epicâ€”built by riders, for riders. If you've got feedback or feature requests, I'm all ears.

Let's dial it in. ðŸšµ
